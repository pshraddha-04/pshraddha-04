### 👋 Hi, I’m Shraddha Patil!
 👀 I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in Data, AI, Machine Learning, and solving real-world problems with code. <br>
      I love to explore new technologies and build projects that have a meaningful impact. Here's a little about what I do:
  
## 🚀 Projects

### 1. **AI-based Student SWOC Analysis**
   - **Goal**: To help students identify their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges (SWOC) using AI models.
   - **Features**:
     - Analyzes student responses to provide personalized feedback.
     - Utilizes machine learning models to predict SWOC for unseen data.
     - Data collected through a Google Form and processed with a hybrid rule-based and classification system.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, XGBoost, Multi-hot Encoding

### 2. **Asthma Detection System**
   - **Goal**: To detect asthma at an early stage using machine learning on a highly imbalanced dataset.
   - **Features**:
     - Built classification models using Neural Networks, XGBoost, SVM, and Random Forest.
     - Applied SMOTE for handling data imbalance and LASSO for feature selection.
     - Conducted comparative analysis on learning rates and model effectiveness.
   - **Tech Stack**: R, Machine Learning (SMOTE, LASSO, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest)

### 3. **CNN-Driven Facial Expression Detection**
   - **Goal**: A hotel booking system with features like booking confirmation, availability checks, and payment simulations.
   - **Features**:
     - Real-time detection of complex emotions through facial expression analysis.
     - Trained on a custom image dataset with real-time recognition capability.
     - Implemented image preprocessing and feature extraction using OpenCV and TensorFlow.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNN

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-based projects, web development, and innovative solutions that can make a real impact on students, education, and user experience.
